# XMU_AutoHealthReporter
 
 
 Powerful tool for those who forget to do the daily health report and get some trouble. Use this to almost immediately get green code and compensate for report of any day you want. ENJOY IT :)
 
 ## Tutorial 
 
 Input your Username and password in above few lines in Report.py, and modify the N to the days you want to do the daily health report. Then run the Report.py and check the result.
 
 Note that your health code will turn green only after the day you check for continous 14days. 
 (Your code won't turn green right after you use this script, but will on the second day)
 
 ## Online Demo

## app
App dir is the project that will be deployed in a server that every one could reach without any code knowledge.
 
 
 ## IMPORTANT 
 I do not encourage any use of this tool. I only provide the code to be studied and used in reaserch.
